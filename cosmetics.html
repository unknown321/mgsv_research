          <h2>Cosmetics</h2>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <blockquote>Throughout history, men have worn hats as a way of showing how much 
              better they are than other men. “I buy hats,” a behatted man seems to say. 
              “I am better than you.”
              <br><br>
              In wartime, hats were a useful way of conferring rank, and ensuring that casualties 
              were confined to the lower classes (hence the famous command of “Don't fire till you 
              see the tops of their heads” at the Battle of Bunker Hill by William Prescott, a 
              general renowned for only shooting enemy combatants who were poor). During peacetime, 
              hats have been instrumental for men to let the non-hatted know just who is wearing 
              the hat around here.

          <img src='images/cosmetics_1.jpg'>
              People need cosmetics and need them badly. MGSV is not an exception.
          </p>
            <br>
            <p>A lot of cosmetics were introduced to Metal Gear with MGO3 - wide variety of headgear 
                along with swimsuits and other tactical stuff. Unfortunately KONAMI forgot to add them 
                to singleplayer. It took them about a year to start porting MGO cosmetics back to TPP 
                as FOB event rewards. Judging by amount of cosmetics, it will take them years to port 
                everything (if they are going to port all of it). But models are already in the game 
                - what stops us from modding it from MGO to TPP?
            </p>
            <hr>
           
            <h3>Porting cosmetics</h3>
            <p>The easiest way would be direct model porting. It is achieved by editing already existing 
            models, usually in hex editor or some 3d software. All model mods on nexusmods are made 
            using those methods. It works, MGO cosmetics are in TPP, but there are issues.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every time you want a cosmetics change, you will have to repack the game archives;</li>
                    <li>process of editing models is definitely not a fast one;</li>
                    <li>cannot switch cosmetics on the fly like the game does;</li>
                    <li>mod packs are huge.</li>
                </ul>
                The best example is <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/228/?">Multi Quiet Player Mod</a>.
                Full version takes <u>1.4 GBs</u>, and even with that you are tied to quiet's face.
            </p>

            <p><u>Conclusion</u>: replacing/editing models sucks. It works, but why would we replace models like that, 
            when the game can do the same programmatically?</p>

            <h3>Coder's way</h3>
            <p>Game is capable of manipulating models/cosmetics in the real time, but how does it do that?
            I've found 5 ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Changing model using user variables (vars.playerFaceId);</li>
                <li>adding new weapon entries;</li>
                <li>chicken hats;</li>
                <li>changing model using fv2 files;</li>
                <li>changing model using .parts files.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>User variables</h3>
            <p>
            By changing <code>vars.playerFaceId</code> and <code>vars.playerType</code>(was it playertype?) you 
            can change your face at will (assuming you play as DD soldier). You can see full list of faces 
            in prettified file <code>Soldier2FaceAndBodyData.lua</code> in 
            <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/45/">Infinite Heaven mod</a>.
            Via changing variables you select one of the predefined face variations - that includes hair, hair colour, 
            skin colour, face paintings, eye color, gender, etc - studying the file will give you a lot of information 
            about that. You can do it using IH - see <a href="https://youtu.be/a0PJJVkDQe8">https://youtu.be/a0PJJVkDQe8</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            What prevents us from using that method? The problem is - faces are pre-baked. Let's take a look at 
            bioengineer from mission 5 "Over the Fence". His glasses are a part of his face and are unseparatable.
            </p>
            <p><img src='images/cosmetics_2.jpg'></p>

            <p>
            More than that, we don't have full control on what will be replaced - we are still bound by pre-baked 
            models. That means that for every head/body cosmetic we will have to make a separate model which will 
            consist of regular model + mgo cosmetic. Not good since we need more freedom - like in mgo where you just 
            put hats on yourself without any modifications to your face/outfit.
            </p>
            <p><u>Conclusion</u>: it sucks, not enough freedom, still need to edit models.</p>

            <h3>New weapon entries</h3>
            <p>By putting on your Night Vision Goggles you change your appearance by the press of the button. 
            Sounds perfect - 8 slots of 'items' gives you some variety. But of course it only sounds nice. 
            <br>
            Issues:
            <ul>
                <li>Green tint for the duration;</li>
                <li>hat model is floating in front of your head, not on top of it;</li>
                <li>texture problems (not like it matters for now);</li>
                <li>NVG has a meter (probably can be set to infinite, equip icon can be hidden as well). 0 = NVG disappears.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><img src='images/cosmetics_3.jpg'></p>
            <p><u>Conclusion</u>: it sucks, can't see hats.</p> 

            <h3>Chicken hats</h3>
            <p>After failing a couple of times game suggests to equip a chicken/chick hat which is attached to 
            the head and looks like a hat - just like we need. No, it doesn't work well enough.
            <br>
            Issues:
            <ul>
                <li>You need to activate chick mode first - it requires reloading a checkpoint so it is not realtime;</li>
                <li>there are only 2 models to replace, which gives us little to none variety (and more frequent repacking);</li>
                <li>hat is attached to the head, what about body costumes (ie underboob outfit)?</li>
                <li>you are stuck in chick/chicken mode, enemies won't attack and chicken head disappears after 3 alerts.</li>
            </ul>
            Also there is no code that can modify behaviour above, just 2 variables that turn chick/chicken mode on and off.
            </p>
            <p><img src='images/cosmetics_5.jpg'></p>
            <p><u>Conclusion</u>: it sucks, not enough freedom, chicken mode on, you are clucking.</p>

            <h3>FV2 files</h3>
            <p>Models in the game are hidden in fmdl files. Important thing is, you can have multiplie models in one fmdl file.</p>
            <p>It was discovered by cra0kalo and volfin - <a href="http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=102492#p102492">http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=102492#p102492</a>.</p>
            <p><img src='images/cosmetics_7.jpg'></p>
            <hr>
            <p>Everything below is my theory on how fv2 files work.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>FOVA probably stands for <b><u>FO</u></b>x<b><u>VA</u></b>riations or whatever.</p>
            <p>There are two instances of game directly using fv2 files to change object's appearance. 
                <ul>
                    <li><code>master/chunk3/Assets/tpp/level/mission2/quest/mtbs/Command/quest_child_dog.lua</code>
                        - DD's model will change in cutscene (the one where doggo becomes big doggo from small doggo).</li>
                    <li>Prologue/truth mission: <br><code>master/0/00/Assets/tpp/level/mission2/story/s10010/s10010_sequence.lua:   s10010_sequence.ChangePlayerFova</code></li>
                </ul>
                First instance can be seen on youtube, search for it yourself; I never bothered with it since it works with
                GameObjects and there are some differences between GameObject and Player objects.
                Second one is much more interesting.
            </p>
            <p>By providing right fv2 file snake drastically changes appearance - his bandage is removed, 
            he gets burns and cuts body-wide (mesh and texture manipulations). 
            All of this without any loadings, instanst. Sounds perfect for our cause.
            </p>
            <p><img src='images/cosmetics_4.jpg'></p>
            <p>Issues:
                <ul>
                    <li>How do we add hat cosmetics into our models? Not as part of main model, but as a separate 
                        model as seen on screenshot from xentax thread? This will require modifying every model - 
                        snake, hospital snake, dd soldier etc (see <code>tpp/master/0/00/Tpp/start.lua</code>, Player.RegisterPartsPackagePath).
                        That will be a huge advantage since there will be many cosmetics in one file giving us freedom 
                        and reducing mod size;
                    </li>
                    <li><u>how do we make a proper fv2 file that will switch models properly?</u> This is the biggest 
                    problem - fv2 files are tiny, have some bytes in them and yet they do so much;</li>
                    <li>applying wrong fv2 file will crash the game.</li>
            </p>
             <p><u>Conclusion</u>: it is a huge improvement over all methods above, multiplie body-wide cosmetics.
             No way of implementing with tools we have atm since cra0kalo broke his release server and apparently 
             stopped his research - <a href="https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1443449&p=49336023&viewfull=1#post49336023">https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1443449&p=49336023&viewfull=1#post49336023</a>.</p>
            
             <h3>Parts</h3>
             <p>All objects in the game consist of parts. As you have seen above, game has different .parts 
             for different types of player. .parts files bind together everything related to the object - 
             .fmdl model, .sim/.ph physics, .frig rig files, .frdv bone files and everything else. Convert 
             it to readable xml using FoxTool.</p>

             <p>
             For example, skullface (<code>chunk0/Assets/tpp/pack/mission2/common/mis_com_skullface.fpkd</code>) 
             consist of his model, 2 models of his hat, 3 ampules with parasites and a case. This sounds <u>perfect</u>.
             Nothing stops us from adding hats to player parts file, just copypaste the structure from skullface and 
             change some paths, pack model/textures and viola. Or at least that's what I thought.
             </p>

             <p>Unfortunately game needs to know which models to render - skullface doesn't run around with case 
             and 2 hats all the time, even though they are referenced in .parts file. How does the game knows what 
             to render at this exact moment? I suppose that is decided by fv2 files, which are a mystery, or 
             it is defined somewhere in demo files.
             </p>
             <p><img src='images/cosmetics_6.jpg'></p>
            <p>There is some code in mgo, that <i>realizes</i> parts and attaches them one to another.
            See file <code>114716d115c13_fpkd/Assets/mgo/script/actor/mgoTeamsneakFlag.lua</code> - mgoTeamsneakFlag.lua 
            exists in multiplie fpks, there are unminified versions of that file with nice variable names. Function 
            this.Construct is the function that is called twice while loading mgo level (cloak and dagger mode). 
            Apparently it creates disk objects and attaches effects to it. Game also attaches blue disk effect above 
            your head using .parts file using code from that lua file.
            <pre><code>if PartsIndex == nil then
    actor:DetachAndTearDownAllParts()
    local success = nil
    success, PartsIndex = MgoParts.Realize( PartsFile, 1, 1 )
    if not success then
        PartsIndex = nil
        Fox.Error( "mgoFlag:Construct(): Failed to realize parts " .. PartsFile )
    else
        actor:AttachParts( PartsIndex )
        MgoParts.SetVisibility( PartsIndex, true )
    end
end</code></pre>
            </p>

            <p>
            However I was unable to reproduce it no matter what. What is 'actor'? It has some nice methods, but I can't 
            find where do you get it - probably this part is called by C part of the engine. There are no classes 
            with these methods in <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/mgsvdump/">my lua dump</a> either. And even 
            if we find out, what is that 'actor' thing is, there might be a chance that there is no such thing in TPP.
            Some classes are MGO exclusive (such as MGOactor and Gear), so even though that 'actor' can attach parts 
            with a handy method, there might be no such class for main game.
            </p>

            <p>Actor instance methods:
            <ul>
             <li>SetTransform</li>
             <li>AttachToGameObject</li>
             <li>AddActionForPlayer</li>
             <li>IsAttached</li>
             <li>GetInitialTransform</li>
             <li>UpdateMarker</li>
             <li>GetMessageValet</li>
             <li>SendMessage</li>
             <li>DisableMarker</li>
             <li>GetTable</li>
             <li>RequestLineCheck</li>
             <li>RemoveActionForPlayer</li>
             <li>SendTriggeredEventSignal</li>
             <li>GetParm</li>
             <li>GetGameObjectId</li>
             <li>GetScaledTime</li>
             <li>GetTransform</li>
             <li>DetachAndTearDownAllParts</li>
             <li>SetActive</li>
             <li>AttachParts</li>
             <li>DetachParts</li>
             <li>Detach</li>
             <li>GetAttachedToGameObject</li>
             <li>IsActive</li>
             <li>EnableMarker</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>I am pretty sure that similar code runs when you call Player.AttachGasMask function (Shining Lights mission):
            game realizes a model, then attaches it to your mouth bone/connect point. Unfortunately the realization is hidden in C.
            </p>

            <p>
            Let's take a look back - at Ground Zeroes. Snake gets a nice cigar after finishing main mission
            - <code>data_02/title_datas_fpkd/Assets/tpp/ui/GraphAsset/gz/gz_title_message.lua</code>
            <pre><code>Fox.Log(":: set tobacco and tobacco motion::")
TppDemoPuppet.CreateAttachmentAndAttachToMtp("title_sneak","cig","MTP_RHAND_A")
TppDemoPuppet.CreateAttachmentPartsEffect("title_sneak", "cig", "CigarSmoke" )
TppDemoPuppet.SetAttachmentMeshVisible("title_sneak", "cig", "MESH_FIRE_IV", true )</code></pre>
            <img src='images/cosmetics_8.gif'>
            <br>
            I <i>assume</i> that "CigarSmoke" and "cig" are listed in .parts file for snake, because I cannot 
            unpack corresponding fpkd files (gzs_tool gives OoM exception while MGSV_FPK_TOOL just closes).
            See <code>data_02\Assets\tpp\pack\player</code> directory.
            </p>

            <p>
            Unfortunately we don't have direct access to TppDemoPuppet class in TPP. Probably it was too low-leveled and 
            KojiPro decided to make nice wraps around it and hide parent class.
            </p>

            <p>
            It seems that effects/attachments have to be listed in .parts listing, judging by file 
            <code>chunk0\Assets\tpp\pack\player\parts\plparts_normal_fpkd\Assets\tpp\parts\chara\sna\sna0_main0_def_v00.parts</code>
            A closer look:
            <pre><code>&lt;entity class="EffectDescription" classVersion="6" addr="0x067B5DB0" unknown1="232" unknown2="39854"&gt;
&lt;staticProperties&gt;
    &lt;property name="name" type="String" container="StaticArray" arraySize="1"&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;EffectDescription0009&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="partName" type="String" container="StaticArray" arraySize="1"&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;EmblemFlare&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="connectDestinationSkelNames" type="String" container="DynamicArray" arraySize="1"&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;SKL_011_LUARM&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;</code></pre>
        What do we see here? Some flare effect on Left Upper Arm - that's diamond on your shoulder that you get after mission 43. 
        It means that effects and additional models mentioned in .parts file are loaded along with your main model; they 
        are toggled by some code hidden from our sight. This effect in particular is activated by 
        <code>Player.SetUseBlackDiamondEmblem()</code> function - no clear realization as in GZ, another wrapper function.
        <img src='images/cosmetics_9.jpg'>
            </p>

            <p><u>Conclusion</u>: This is the way how things should be done - attaching objects one to another using code.
            The moment we understand what 'actor' is and how to 'realize' parts without MgoParts class, realtime change 
            of cosmetics in singleplayer will become a reality: just pack some hat fmdls into your player pack, add some 
            entries in .parts file then change cosmetics with a couple of code strings. 
            Until then hex editor and humongous mods are the only answer.</p>
