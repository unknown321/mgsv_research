        <h3>FV2</h3>
            <p>FV2 files (Form Variation) are used in MGSV:GZ and MGSV:TPP to change the appearance of models.</p>
            <p>They are used to show and hide meshes, apply different textures to meshes, apply physical 
            simulation files, attach models and probably something else. </p>
            <p>Before going into details, I need to explain how MGSV handles models.</p>

        <h3>Models</h3>
            <p>This info relates only to player and NPC models, wasn't interested in vehicles/weapons/animals.</p>
            <p>TPP models usually consist of 2 parts - head and body.</p>
                <img src='images/fv2_1.png'>
                <img src='images/fv2_2.png'>
            <p>It allows the game to modify face without affecting the body and vice versa, 
            i.e. equipping balaclava or changing your camo pattern.</p>
            <p>Game uses it's own mechanism to attach head to the body, probably using .parts files 
            (without using fv2 to do it). I think that this mechanism is used in function
            <code>Player.AttachGasMask()</code> and <code>Player.VisibleGasMask()</code>
            (mission 43 Shining Lights, when Snake puts on his respirator).</p>
            <p>Models have mesh, bones and connection point identificators in them. These
            identificators are used in .fv2 in hashed form to specify the element to modify.
            Partial list of these hashes was compiled by <a href='http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=121100#p121100'>YouRePrettyGood</a>.
            Hashing method is unknown. Only first 4 bytes of these hashes are used in fv2,
            full hashes can be found in fmdl.</p>
        
            <hr>
            <p>It means that in order to hide some mesh on Snake's face we need to:
            <ul>
                <li>Find his current face model;</li>
                <li>find corresponding mesh and it's name</li>
                <li>make a fv2 file that will hide mesh using it's name.</li>
            </ul>

            Unfortunately there are problems.<br>
            Problem #1: it is hard to find hashed name of mesh, fmdl is not fully explored 
            (or at least I am unaware of it).<br>
            Problem #2: you need a command to show/hide meshes.<br>

        <h3>FV2 commands</h3>
            <p>In order to manipulate parts of model, fv2 needs not only names of these parts,
            but also commands on how to manipulate them.</p>
            <p>These commands are also hashed in the same way as mesh names, but 
            there are no unhashed names. A couple of them are included in list above 
            (<code>Base_Tex_SRGB</code> for example), but others are a complete mystery.
            Command are usually followed by a link to hashed filepath.
            Providing wrong filepath or wrong filetype will usually crash the game, 
            i.e. the 'apply texture' command accepts only textures, 'hide mesh' 
            accepts hashed mesh names.</p>
            <p>You will also need to use right syntax, which differs from command 
            to command. This is also a big problem.</p>

        <h3>Format structure</h3>
        <p>First structure was made by <a href='http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=121318#p121318'>YouRePrettyGood</a>.
        Most of that info is right, but some sections are doubtful. Please keep in mind that 
        I digged format with only one purpose - to combine 2 fmdls, so some bytes 
        were ignored.</p>
        <p>I am using file master\chunk0\fpks\plfova_sna0_face6_v00_fpk\Assets\tpp\fova\chara\sna\sna0_face6_v00.fv2 as an example.</p>

                            These fovas have 2 referenced models in section 4 - can it be the count of fmdl files?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Byte 0x25 has 2 states:
                    <ul>
                        <li>00: almost every single fv2 file</li>
                        <li>01: 33 files, including mgo hats</li>

                <li>4 unknown bytes, never bothered to look into them.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Section 1</h5>
        <p>
            Section 1 contains links to files from section 4 and commands on how to use them.
            This differs from file to file, sometimes section 1 is really small, sometimes 
            it is really big. Usually it has a link to the main model, 0000 in our case.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Address: 0x28-until the beginning of section 2.
        </p>
        <p>In the file sna0_face6_v00.fv2 section 1 is pretty small and has only 2 entries.
        <ul>
            <li>Entry 1: 0x28-0x30, 8 bytes, <code>0000 FFFF FFFF FFFF</code>. 
                0000 is a link to the first file in section 4 (head model, 
                sna0_face6_cov.fmdl, in the same fpk).
            </li>
           <li>Entry 1: 0x28-0x30, 8 bytes, <code>0100 FFFF 0000 0000</code>. 
                0100 is a link to the second file in section 4 (sim file for bandana, 
                sna0_bdn0_def.sim, in fpkd).
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h5>Section 2</h5>
        <p>
            Section 2 also contains links to files from section 4 (2 bytes per link) 
            and commands on how to use them (4 bytes per command).
            This also differs from file to file, sometimes section 2 is empty, sometimes 
            it is really big. It has links to models and textures. In our case it is empty.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Address: referenced in index section.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Section 3</h5>
        <p>
            Section 3 is always empty, as YouRePrettyGood claims. I haven't seen section 3 
            with elements either.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Address: referenced in index section.
        </p>

        <h5>Section 4</h5>
        <p>
            Section 4 contains reversed hashed filenames, 8 bytes long. They are hashed using CityHash64.
        </p>
        <p>
            Address: referenced in index section.
        </p>
            How to read hashes:
            <ul>
                <li>Split hash by 2 symbols: 42 5A EA A1 88 A5 A2 84;</li>
                <li>Reverse their order: 84 A2 A5 88 A1 EA 5A 42;</li>
                <li>Drop first 2 bytes (file extension): A5 88 A1 EA 5A 42.</li>
            </ul>
            Now you can use that hash to find the corresponding file like this:
            <pre><code>unknown@vault MINGW64 /j/mgs/mgsv_lua_dump/tpp/master (master)
$ grep -ri --include=*\.txt --include=*\.inf a588a1ea5a42
inf/0/00/fpks/output.txt:tpp/chara/sna/Scenes/sna0_face6_cov    a588a1ea5a42
inf/chunk0/fpks/output.txt:tpp/chara/sna/Scenes/sna0_face6_cov  a588a1ea5a42
</code></pre>
            I am using grep bundled with <a href='https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/'>git for windows</a>.
            Filehashes for all files in .fpk(d) and .dat files can be found at 
            <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/mgsv_lua_dump/tree/master/tpp/master/inf">this repository</a>.
            You can use github search as well, but sometimes it refuses to find text, 
            so I advise you to clone the repo and search for hashes locally. If you cannot find 
            the file, remove a couple of symbols from the beginning, i.e. 8a1ea5a42.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Getting hashes for new files is also possible by using 
            <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/mgsv_path_hasher">mgsv_path_hasher</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extensions are (probably) constant and you can easily recognize them:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hash</td><td>Type</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>A2 84</td><td>fmdl</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <p>
            As stated before, FV2 files have commands that do various actions with linked files.

        <p>
            These are commands that I've found in fv2 by using tables provided by YouRePrettyGood.
            Division between targets and command is based on command's name. Count numbers may be 
            slightly off (±5) due to mods and me being unaccurate with files.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes commands have really weird syntax. Let's take a look at 
            <code>chunk0\plparts_hospital_fpk\Assets\tpp\fova\chara\sna\sna1_v04.fv2</code>.
            This is fova responsible for adding dirt and cuts to snake during prologue.
        </p>
            <img src='images/cosmetics_4.jpg'>
            <img src='images/fv2_6.png'>
        <p>
            As we can see, commands (1 and 2) are repeating without any file 
            links. Links are put separately from commands (3) in some sort of array.
            The amount of FFFF-padding is also huge. I have a feeling that this 
            is related to <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/MDL#Skin_replacement_tables">this</a>, 
            but I am not interested in textures that much.<br>
            Side note: this fova is using 7 textures:
            <table>
                <tr><td>2898587abb9ab.ftex</td><td>face</td></tr>
                <tr><td>10a9f5617b387.ftex</td><td>facemask</td></tr>
                <tr><td>25b1e1d8ac451.ftex</td><td>bandage</td></tr>
                <tr><td>19db40a9af383.ftex</td><td>body</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2be12abeb1323.ftex</td><td>bodymask</td></tr>
                <tr><td>25bd197efbf1e.ftex</td><td>pants</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3fc288b2d1607.ftex</td><td>pants mask</td></tr>
            </table>
            Only one texture for bandage, why mask is not needed? This fova also 
            has a command to toggle meshes on and off, should look into it (for 
            possible removal of snake's eyepatch for example) .
        </p>

        <h3>Important commands</h3>
        <p>
            After weeks of digging, I've found 2 commands which apparently allow you to attach 
            models to other models.
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hash</td><td>Command</td><td>Count</td>
                </tr>
                <tr><td>0E642277</td><td>mostly used in MGO in hat fv2</td><td>19</td></tr>
                <tr><td>EB77FEBF</td><td>used for combining 2 models together</td><td>31</td></tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <p>
            First hash (0E642277) is used in both MGO and TPP. It's present in mgo hat fv2, using it in TPP 
            fovas does nothing, so it may be MGO-only. Still, it should be noted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second hash (EB77FEBF) is what I was looking for. It takes 2 arguments:
            <ul>
                <li>Skeleton hash, 4 bytes, usually it is 989F16BF (ALWAYS FIRST SKL HASH). 
                It can be replaced with FFFFFFFF with no visible issues. I have tried 
                to replace it with other target hashes (ie SKL_004_HEAD), but without 
                success - attached model moves to your feet. Probably it happens 
                because there is no such SKL hash in head's model.</li>
                <li>Link to the fmdl file, 2 bytes.</li>
            </ul>
            It should be noted that this command puts referenced model in the 
            center of base model.
        </p>
            Example: <img src='images/fv2_5.png'>
        <p>
            If you don't provide the command, leaving just a link to the fmdl file, it will be rendered 
            at your feet. Link has to be put in some special order, moving it by 2 bytes left or right 
            makes it disappear. Command has to be present in some special position as well, otherwise 
            nothing will render (or the game will crash).

        </p>
        <p>
            In the example above you can see a link to head model (0000) without 
            any commands and yet head is placed in the right place. However, replacing 
            the head model with another non-head model (I used mgo hats) moves the new 'head' 
            to your feet. 
        </p>
            <img src='images/fv2_12.png'>
        <p>
            I have 2 explanations for that:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Game recognizes that head model and body model have 
                    matching connection points and attaches them one to another;
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are special flags in the model i.e. head/body; game 
                    takes the 'head' and attaches it to the 'body'. No flag - 
                    render it at the feet level.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Model rendering also depends on byte 0x24 and 0x25 in index section. 
            In order to render both models both bytes have to have a value of 01. 
            I was unable to find a relation between the amount of models and the 
            fact of render. 
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Byte</td><td>Value</td><td>Note</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0x24</td><td>00</td><td>No models rendered</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0x24</td><td>01</td><td>Both models rendered</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0x24</td><td>02</td><td>Both models rendered</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0x25</td><td>00</td><td>New model moves to feet</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0x25</td><td>01</td><td>Both models rendered</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>

        <p>
            There are only 18 fv2 files with 2 models which can be used for further research on 
            that command. My mods are based on cm_unq_v003_eye1.fv2 since it's the cleanest one,
            other fovas such as pfs ones have a lot of stuff inside.

        There are no fv2 with 3 and more models. My attempts in adding a third one 
        were futile, game either crashed or ignored new fmdls. Feel free to try 
        yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>Exploring the fv2</h3>
        <p>
            Copy hex values of fv2 file to your favorite text editor, 
            split file by sections, then use the list of hashes to replace 
            all known hashes with text. It will make file much clearer:

        script for Hex Workshop by YouRePrettyGood</a>, but it is 
        really slow on some fv2. It is useful for big files, but text editor is 
        faster.

        <h3>Applying the fova</h3>
        <p>
            After making modifications you need to apply the fova to your model. 
            However there are problems. <code>Player.ApplyFormVariationWithFile</code> 
            doesn't work with head fovas at all, but only with body fovas. There 
            might be an additional parameter to that function to choose the region, 
            but I was unable to find one. It means that for head you will have to 
            replace existing head fovas. Fortunately there are only 16 of them 
            (not including battledress headcovers, mgs1 snake etc.)

            Fovas with (+chick/chicken mask) have masks models in them. By changing 
            chicken fova, you will change your regular appearance (even when you 
            are not in chicken mode), chick fova is for chick hat mode only.

        <p>
            There is some clipping, but this is definitely working. There are 
            problems with distance between added cosmetic and head model. Distance 
            changes because of player's base stance. Male and female soldiers have 
            different poses. I think it was counted for MGO cosmetics (hence male 
            and female hat versions), but there are no 'legal' cosmetics 
            for TPP. Poses also change for different outfits (same head fova):
        </p>
            <img src='images/fv2_11.jpg'>
        <p>
            Another problem: attached hats are not counted as player's model. 
            They are not disappearing in first person, obstructing view. It it unavoidable 
            for soldier-wide cosmetics (see fmdl fixes below).

        <h3>Soldier-wide cosmetics' fixes</h3>
        <p>
            As stated above, you can change appearance of all your soldiers by 
            modifying fova with chicken hat (plfova_plf0_msk0_v00.fpk, plfova_sna0_msk0_v00.fpk).
            But only 2 models work with it without having to enable chicken mode:
            <ul>
                <li>ewr3_eqhd0_cov.fmdl - hideo's glasses</li>
                <li>ewr0_eqhd0_cov.fmdl - ocelot's glasses</li>
            </ul>
            Other models don't appear unless you turn on chicken mode. There is a fix, which 
            requires a little bit of hex editing. Simply replace 
            <pre><code>MESH_ROOT (ALWAYS FIRST MESH HASH) 35D648F974580000</code></pre>
            with 
            <pre><code>MESH_ROOT_V2 782A0D778E800000</code></pre> in fmdl.
            That will make model to render no matter what.
            <b><u>Game will crash if you change player character (i.e. snake-ddsoldier-snake).</u></b>

        <p>
            <code>MESH_ROOT_V2</code> was found by comparing glasses models using 
            <a href=" https://github.com/Jayveerk/FMDL/blob/master/MGSV%20FMDL%20PC.ms">
            3dsmax fmdl script by Jayveerk</a>. I had to rewrite it in Python <b>2</b> to avoid 
            launching 3dsmax every time I need to look at model's structure - <a href='mods/fv2/fmdl_parser_v2.py'>link</a>.
            I've also expanded fmdl hashes list a little with hashes from 
            skullface's hat (GZ and TPP versions, 62e7efe72cb98bb3d8b88977dcc9414f.fmdl - 
            wsp0_eqhd0_def.fmdl) and both glasses. <a href="mods/fv2/fmdl_name_hashes.txt">New hashes list</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Important note on visibility:<br>
            Models used in *face* fovas can be hidden in first-person mode - just use MESH_ROOT for them and they will 
            be hidden.<br>
            However, models used in *msk* fovas must have MESH_ROOT_V2 to be shown and will obstruct your vision.
            If you want to play with glasses, I suggest adding them to *face* fovas and leave hats for *msk* fova
        </p>

        <h4>Getting more hashes / exploring fmdl</h4>
        <p>
            Python script above was made to print fmdl sections in human form.
            Most sections have descriptions from the author in the script.
            Notable sections:
            <ul>
                <li>1.21 - reversed texture hashes</li>
                <li>1.22 - command hashes, same as in fv2.</li>
            </ul>
            If you want to get more command hashes and their names, you can compare 
            similar files from GZ and TPP. GZ fmdls have names at the end of the file, 
            while TPP has them in section 1.22.
        </p>
        <img src="images/fv2_14.png">

        <p>
            You can also move fmdls without 3dsmax with python script:
            <pre><code>move_fmdl = True
print_sections = True
offset = [0, 0, 0.1]
parse_fmdl(r'C:\1.fmdl', print_sections, move_fmdl, offset)</code></pre>
will make: C:\1_moved.fmdl and C:\1_sections.txt. There are some offsets at the beginning of the script.
        </p>

        <p>Script can apply mesh fixes as well: <code>fmdl_mesh_fix(r'C:\1.fmdl')</code> will overwrite the file with fixed mesh.</p>

        <h3>MGO hats</h3>
        <p>
            MGO hats can be added using the same way. Problems:
        </p>
            <img src='images/fv2_9.png'>
            <img src='images/fv2_10.jpg'>
        <p>
            In the first image you can clearly see the offset between cap and 
            glasses+beret combo (beret is the violet ugly thing).
            Second image shows that offset ingame. It can be fixed by providing frdv file and 
            adding it to your fv2 file. 
        </p>

        <h3>How to mod MGO hats</h3>
        <p>
            Find a model you want to use (let's say hat0_main0_def.fmdl). Parse it with fmdl script to find out shift for section 1.22 and 1.21 (<code>print_sections=True</code>). Open fmdl in hex editor, replace   
            <code>35D648F974580000</code> with <code>782A0D778E800000</code> (section 1.22) to make it visible.
            <hr>
            Copy hashes from section 1.21 and reverse them (order is important):
            <pre><code>156b3dcb9e506351
156855d8625e430c
156884483e1c10b0
156938337d71ab4b
1569886cb15d7938</code></pre>
        Unpack texture0.dat using MGSV_QAR_TOOL. Open texture0.inf and search for last 8 characters from hashes (i.e. 625e430c). Copy files you found 
        (33dcb9e506351.2.ftexs and 33dcb9e506351.3.ftexs) to any folder you like. Find related pftxs - hat_m00.pftxs. Unpack it using gsz_tool. Gather all textures in one folder. Rename then in the same order as they were in fmdl:<pre><code>156b3dcb9e506351 - tex1.ftex
156855d8625e430c - tex2.ftex
156884483e1c10b0 - tex3.ftex
156938337d71ab4b - tex4.ftex
1569886cb15d7938 - tex5.ftex</code></pre>Rename ftexs in the same way (tex1.1.ftexs).<hr>
        Unpack <code>0\00\Assets\tpp\pack\resident\resident00.pftxs</code> with gsz_tool. Go to <code>Assets\tpp\hats\textures\mgo\allclass\hat0</code> (create missing folders). Put your textures there.
        Create test.dat.xml:
        <pre><code>&lt?xml version="1.0"?&gt
&ltArchiveFile xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xsi:type="QarFile" Name="test.dat" Flags="3150304"&gt
  &ltEntries&gt
    &ltEntry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex1.ftex" Compressed="false" /&gt
    &ltEntry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex2.ftex" Compressed="false" /&gt
    &ltEntry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex3.ftex" Compressed="false" /&gt
    &ltEntry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex4.ftex" Compressed="false" /&gt
  &lt/Entries&gt
&lt/ArchiveFile&gt</code></pre>
        Put your new renamed textures into test_dat directory with same paths.
        Pack it into .dat file with gsz_tool. Add <pre><code>/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex1
/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex2
/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex3
/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex4</code></pre>
        to your dictionary.txt for MGSV_QAR_TOOL. Unpack test.dat, open 
        test.inf. Get hashes out of it (don't forget to reverse them):
        <pre><code>08 ff 7e cd b4 81 6a 15 | Assets\tpp\hats\textures\mgo\allclass\hat0\tex1.ftex
64 0e 7e ab 16 9e 6a 15 | Assets\tpp\hats\textures\mgo\allclass\hat0\tex2.ftex
cd 84 cc a6 d7 f2 6b 15 | Assets\tpp\hats\textures\mgo\allclass\hat0\tex3.ftex
d3 73 85 dc df 5b 6b 15 | Assets\tpp\hats\textures\mgo\allclass\hat0\tex4.ftex
70 dc d6 27 ec 93 69 15 | Assets\tpp\hats\textures\mgo\allclass\hat0\tex5.ftex</code></pre>
        Open hat0_main0_def.fmdl with your favorite hex editor. 
        Go to the address of section 1.21 (provided by python script).
        Replace hashes in the same order, one by one. Save fmdl.<hr>
        Add textures to resident00.pftxs:<pre><code>&ltEntry&gt
    &ltEntries xmlns="Pftxs"&gt
        &ltEntryData FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex1.ftex" /&gt
        &ltEntryData FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex1.1.ftexs" /&gt
        &ltEntryData FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex1.2.ftexs" /&gt
        &ltEntryData FilePath="/Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/allclass/hat0/tex1.3.ftexs" /&gt
    &lt/Entries&gt
&lt/Entry&gt</code></pre>
    Pack resident.pftxs. Add your model to resident00.fpk using gsz_tool or MGSV_FPK_TOOL. Calculate hash for fmdl using method above for textures - this is important. 
    Edit fv2 template, replace last 8 bytes (FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) with fmdl hash. Pack fv2. Launch the game. If the model is in the wrong position, move it using either python script, or manually in 3dsmax with <a href="http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=120622#p120622">vertex script</a> (<a href="http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=121065#p121065">how?</a>).

        <h3>For the lazy</h3>
        <p>
            I've ported almost all MGO hats to TPP.<br>
            <a href='http://imgur.com/a/5rVAE'>http://imgur.com/a/5rVAE</a> - previews.<br>
            You can find models and textures here - <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!ZwR3iLIS!D95yuDdUUJt1Wm0TkfX97Q">mega</a>.
            <br>How to use:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Select hats you want to use (see 'previews' directory for filenames). Hats have different offsets for Snake/Avatar, DD soldier and DD soldier (female).</li>
                <li>
                    If you selected MGO hats, you will need textures. Grab them from 'textures' directory, only for hats you want to use.</li>
                <li>
                    Unpack resident00.fpk (00.dat) with gzs/fpk tool, add fmdls saving the same structure: <code>/Assets/tpp/hats/__soldier_type__/__game_type__/(__hat_type__)/__filename.fmdl__</code>
                    You'll need __hat_type__ only for mgo hats. Pack it back.</li>
                <li>
                    MGO textures: find resident00.pftxs (01.dat). Unpack with gzs_tool, add textures saving the same structure: <code>Assets/tpp/hats/textures/mgo/__hat_type__/__hat_name__/tex[0-9].([1-3].)ftex(s)</code>. Make xml entries for every file added (or just grab them from pftxs_entries.txt in models directory which is not available for all models because I forgot to save one file). Order is important: ftex->ftexs.1->ftexs.2 etc. Pack it back. You cannot have too many textures at once in one pftxs - game has a limit. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xrL8oKw.jpg">What happens when you hit the limit.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select fovas depending on what player type you chose:
                    <ul>
                        <li>plfova_plf0_msk0_v00 - female</li>
                        <li>plfova_sna0_msk0_v00 - male/snake/avatar</li>
                        <li>plfova_sna0_face(0-2)_v00 - snake/avatar without bandana</li>
                        <li>plfova_sna0_face(4-6)_v00 - snake/avatar with bandana</li>
                    </ul>
                    These fpks can be found in 00.dat and chunk0.dat. Unpack them, grab the corresponding template from 'fv2' directory on mega. Open the template fv2 with hex editor, replace last 8 bytes (FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) with hat hash from 'player_fmdl_name_hashes.txt'. Replace original fv2 with edited template. Pack fpk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add resident00.fpk, resident00.pftxs and plfova you chose to 00.dat. Pack .dat and launch the game. If it crashed, you did something wrong.
                </li>
            </ul>
            FPK/PFTXS structure (truncated):
            <img src='images/fv2_15.png'>
            <hr>
            You can use combinations of 2 fovas to have many cosmetics on snake (plfova_sna0_msk0_v00 + plfova_sna0_face). I also believe that you can have up to 4 cosmetics on dd soldiers (by editing hair, face deco and skin fovas for one particular soldier - see bioengie).
            <hr>
            Some hats have clipping with your model (especially full-head models). It happens because soldiers have different head shapes and you need to adjust model coordinates for every soldier. Can be solved by making a proper frdv file (or just move them with python script).
            <hr>
            Physics are missing for some models. You can enable them by adding .sim file to fv2. You can find .sim files in models/ddmale/sim directory.
            <hr>
            Three hats are broken - MGO dd beret, afro and ponytail. Maybe it has something to do with MESH_ROOT_V2, I was unable to make them look good. Use beret from tpp instead.
